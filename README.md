# Algonive Python Programming Internship Task Two

## Project Title
AI Chatbot for Customer Support

## Project Description
This project is developed as part of my Python Programming internship at Algonive. The main objective is to create an intelligent chatbot capable of assisting users with customer support queries. It is designed to automate responses and provide real-time assistance, which is a common requirement in industries like e-commerce and healthcare.

In this project, I have explored the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to ensure the bot understands user intent and provides relevant answers. My focus was on keeping the interaction simple and the logic efficient.

## Key Features
- Input Processing: The bot takes text input from the user and identifies key words.
- Automated Response: It provides predefined answers for common questions.
- Support Logic: It can handle basic frequently asked questions (FAQs).
- Error Handling: The bot is programmed to respond politely when it does not understand a query.
